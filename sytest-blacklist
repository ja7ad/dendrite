# Blacklisted due to https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec/issues/942
The only membership state included in a gapped incremental sync is for senders in the timeline

# Flakey
AS-ghosted users can use rooms themselves
AS-ghosted users can use rooms via AS
Events in rooms with AS-hosted room aliases are sent to AS server
Inviting an AS-hosted user asks the AS server
Accesing an AS-hosted room alias asks the AS server
If user leaves room, remote user changes device and rejoins we see update in /sync and /keys/changes
New federated private chats get full presence information (SYN-115)

# This will fail in HTTP API mode, so blacklisted for now
If a device list update goes missing, the server resyncs on the next one

# Might be a bug in the test because leaves do appear :-(
Leaves are present in non-gapped incremental syncs

# We don't have any state to calculate m.room.guest_access when accepting invites
Guest users can accept invites to private rooms over federation

# Tests Synapse specific behavior
/state returns M_NOT_FOUND for an outlier
/state_ids returns M_NOT_FOUND for an outlier

# this is a silly restriction as it basically stops servers from communicating, so we relax it
# see https://github.com/element-hq/synapse/issues/7543
